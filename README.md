# 🎸 Guitar Trainer

**Guitar Trainer** is a desktop application for learning and memorizing notes on the guitar fretboard.  
It helps you practice note recognition, fretboard positions, and weak areas using adaptive training and heatmaps.

This project started as a personal learning tool and evolved into a **robust, cross-platform desktop application** with a strong focus on stability, usability, and clean architecture.
